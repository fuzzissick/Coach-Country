# Coach Country


Coach country is a android application currently in development to allow a coach to track runners realtime. Some features of my application (current and future) include

  - Map tracking for a runner to view
  - Session history, including milage, pace, distance and time
  - Presence tracking, for coaches and runners
  - View all sessions in the past

# Current Status

  - Currently I am working on fixing themeing and session history for the user. Development on the coaching portion of the application will begin soon.
